My goto coding copilot test: word tracing game for kids to learn writing.

My previous attempts:
- gemini 2.5 pro (canvas mode): https://github.com/ruotianluo/chinese-learning/blob/main/index_eng2.html
- gemini 3.0 pro (canvas mode): https://github.com/ruotianluo/chinese-learning/blob/main/index_eng3.html
- Agent mode in chatgpt: terrible, although it can browser use.

This is new attempt using antigravity and free opus 4.5:
- looks the best.
- the UI is pretty.
- It can actually browser use and analyze the screenshot. (canvas mode cannot do that) It helps a bit i think. I was expecting it to be more proactive to find UI issue, but unfortunately it still needs me.
